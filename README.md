# Doom Scrolling

## Core and Game Code

### Details

- This was a first solo dev project with the goal to go from planning and design, to development, all the way through to publishing to both the Android and iOS stores. A lot of experimentation was done within the code to get a better understanding of how things work, and how it functions in Unity. Due to timeline and just playing with the systems, much of this code was not refactored or cleaned up as I was ready to move on to another project. There are a lot of nasty hacks and work arounds within in this code, but overall I learned a ton from this project, and would love to one day come back and see how much I've improved, so I'm leaving the code as is.
- Please reach out if you have any questions or would like some insights on the existing code.
